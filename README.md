### 🔍 Fruit Catalog Automation (Ubuntu + Python)
- **Stack**: Python, JSON, Pillow (PIL), ReportLab, Bash, Git, Ubuntu Linux
- **What I did**: Built an automation script that reads fruit data from a JSON file, resizes corresponding product images, and generates a professional PDF report. Designed the project to run in a Linux (Ubuntu) environment and organized it with a modular folder structure. Set up Git version control and pushed the complete project to GitHub for portfolio showcasing.
